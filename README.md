- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OrlandoSepiol
  I'm interested in learning how to automate tasks using Python;
  I'd also love to share everything I learn so that any new programmer could
  also learn from what I've learnt (pretty much giving back to the community).
  Finally, I also have a keen interest in Exploitation in general. I'm curious to learn
  the process of exploitation of a system or a website or even of an app.
  This interest goes along with the Ethical application of the knowledge I will be learning.
  
- ðŸ“– As of now I'm a web developer in progress.
- I have a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Python.
- I'm looking forward to expand and master such skills.
